#
# Same shape as the one next door: SwiftPM builds the executable, and a macOS
# app bundle is just a folder with a plist and the binary in the right place.
#
# The three files keep the same names from release to release, so the site
# links to them once and the updater reads one address forever. ./publish.sh
# copies them into the site.
#
# Two builds from 1.0.5, each for one kind of Mac: Apple Silicon, in build/,
# and Intel, in build/intel/, served from the site's intel/ folder
# with an appcast of its own. A single universal app would have weighed
# twice as much for everyone (10.9 MB of binary instead of 5.4). The app's
# updater reads the feed for the chip it was built for (Updater.feed).
# AURA_ARCH picks the chip; without it, the Mac's own.
#
# "dmg" lays the disk image's window out with dmgbuild, installed into .build
# on first use (Python 3 and a network, once).
#
# What "ship" needs, once:
#   - a Developer ID Application certificate in the login keychain
#     (AURA_SIGN_IDENTITY names it; otherwise the first one found is used)
#   - a notarytool profile: xcrun notarytool store-credentials "aura"
#     (AURA_NOTARY_PROFILE names it; default "aura")
#   - AURA_DOWNLOAD_URL, the https folder the three files are served from,
#     for the appcast. Default https://catskys.github.io/Aura, which is
#     where Updater.feed in Updater.swift looks.
#
# NOTES.md, next to this script, is what's new: newest release first, one
# paragraph each. The first paragraph goes into the appcast, and from there
# under the version line in Settings.
